Hi, my name is John. I'm a render programmer from Germany with an MSc in scientific computing and a BSc in physics. I have a passion for gamedev, computer graphics, and open source. In my spare time, I participate in gamejams, experiment in game engines and sometimes write about it. Here you can find all the neat stuff I've been working on so far. Enjoy your stay!
