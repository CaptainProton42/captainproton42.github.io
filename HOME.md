Hi, my name is John. I'm a former physics and current scientific computing student from Germany with a passion for gamedev, computer graphics, and open source. In my spare time, I like to participate in gamejams, experiment in game engines and sometimes write about it. Here you can find all the neat stuff I've worked on so far. Enjoy your stay!
